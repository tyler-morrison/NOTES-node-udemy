# HTTP

**HTTP** = A set of rules for data being transferred on the web. Stands for “HyperText Transform Protocol”.

**MIME Type** = A standard for specifying the type of data being sent. Stands for “Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions” – Ex. application/json, text/html, image/jpeg, etc. Within Node, we can easily specify MIME types.
