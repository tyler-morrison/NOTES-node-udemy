# Pipes

**Pipe** = Connecting two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another. In Node you pipe from a Readbale stream to a Writable stream.

Just like you use literal pipes to connect plumbing, a similar concept is used in the context of data. These pipes can be chained in different varieties of readble, writatble, duplex, etc. to create more sophisticated paths for data.

**Method Chaining** = A method returns an object so ew can keep calling more methods. Sometimes it returns the parent object – called *cascading* – and sometimes it returns some other object.
