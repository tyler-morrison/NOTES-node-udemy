# APIs & Endpoints

**API (Application Programming Interface)** = A set of tools for building a software. On the web, these are the tools – usually URLs – that are made available to send / receive data.

**Endpoint** = One URL in a web API. Sometimes that endpoint does multiple things by making choices based on the HTTP request headers.
