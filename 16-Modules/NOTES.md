# Modules

**Modules** = A reusable block of code, whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.

**CommonJS Modules** = An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

## First-Class Functions

**First-Class Functions** = Everything you can do with other types — strings, numbers, etc. — you can do with functions.

Recall that this feature is something that many other languages do *NOT* have.

**Expressions** = A block of code that results in a value. Function expressions are possible in Javascript because functions are first-class.
